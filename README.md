This is the code for my public personal website: https://michael.haddon.me/

I wanted to see if I could create a webapp with the engine I made for the Hackathon I attended: https://github.com/mhaddon/HackJSY

I also knew I needed my own personal website (I have had some before, but they were often just wordpress themes or what have you.)

I decided to do both at the same time, this is the merged fusion of these ideas.
This is NOT an example of a real-world application, and I WOULD NOT make a website normally like this.
This was a fun experiment to learn more about Javascript, and just fun in general.
